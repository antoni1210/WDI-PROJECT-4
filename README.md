# Project 4: Ticketmania - Full-stack RESTful application

### Overview

TicketMania is an event ticket marketplace on which users can buy, sell and exchange tickets with other users.

### Brief

The application should:

- Use the React framework
- Use Mongo, Express and Node for the back-end
- Use RESTful routing
- Consume at least one third-party API and render information from it on the front-end
- Feature authentication to grant access for users
- Incorporate some degree of both front and back-end testing
- Be deployed online so that it can be accessed publicly

We used Trello to prioritise and keep track of each aspect of the project, which was especially useful when working as part of a team.

### Challenges and issues

- Being able to return the data we wanted from Ticketmaster's API and manipulate it in the way that we desired was trickier than expected.
- We initially got a little overwhelmed in terms of how heavily we might rely on the API's we used.
- A few merging issues set us back a little at times, but we were able to rectify these.

### Wins

- Despite a few merge hiccups, working as a team using Trello was very smooth.
- Eventually getting some of the data we wanted from Ticketmaster's API was a joyous occasion.

### Future developments and tweaks

- Being able to auto-populate a new ticket listing with predetermined data from Ticketmaster's API rather than the user having to input each field.
- Some of the colours used in the styling are a bit garish.
- Address some of the clunky UX.
